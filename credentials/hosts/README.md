# Host-Specific Credentials Directory

This directory contains credentials generated for each managed host.

## Structure

Each host will have its own subdirectory named after the inventory hostname:

```
hosts/
  └── hostname/
      ├── root_pass.txt
      ├── ansible_pass.txt
      ├── sysadmin_pass.txt
      ├── salts/
      │   ├── root_salt.txt
      │   ├── ansible_salt.txt
      │   └── sysadmin_salt.txt
      └── [service-specific credentials]
```

## Service-Specific Credentials

Some hosts may have additional credential files depending on the services they run:
- `gitlab_root_pass.txt` - GitLab root password
- `searxng_secret_key.txt` - SearXNG secret key
- `initial_password.txt` - Initial password for services like qBittorrent
- `mongo_root_password.txt` - MongoDB root password
- `mongo_unifi_password.txt` - MongoDB UniFi user password

These are automatically generated by Ansible playbooks and stored securely, they should not be deleted unless doing a fresh install.
